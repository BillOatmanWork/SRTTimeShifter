1
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,890
Would you look this way please?

2
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,594
Okay!

3
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,415
One moment.

4
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,500
Mr. President, all systems activated.

5
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:10,233
- I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.
- Oh no, not at all.

6
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,800
Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
It's a marvelous achievement.

7
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:13,743
Thank you sir.

8
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:15,528
- Hear, Hear!
- The limousine is ready for here.

9
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:21,300
Of course it's gonna put me out of a job
and put the Pentagon in mothballs, but ah...

10
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,024
- Congratulations Dr. Forbin.
- I'm quite sure that won't happen.

11
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:26,600
Listen to him,
he's more relieved than anybody.

12
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:31,100
Well the Secretary of Defense and
the Secretary of State and myself er...

13
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,950
had a discussion on our way out here
and as to the treatment needed,

14
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
when we tell the country about it.

15
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,670
And er...

16
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,121
we all agree it should
be simple and direct.

17
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:40,740
Yes.

18
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,567
Downgrade the biggest top-secret
in all history, to plain unclassified.

19
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,800
Now all we have to do
is tell the people about it.

20
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,600
Thank you sir.

21
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,060
My friends,

22
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:08,945
fellow citizens of the world.

23
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:12,017
For years we have been delicately
and desperately poised

24
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,919
upon the brink of a disaster,

25
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,774
too complete and horrible to contemplate.

26
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,600
There is an old saying:
Everyone makes mistakes,

27
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,085
but that is just
what man can no longer afford.

28
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:25,609
For years, we here in the United States
have been working on that problem.

29
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,802
Until now it's been our most
closely guarded secret,

30
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:32,224
involving great effort,
and vast expenditure,

31
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,892
but it has been met with success.

32
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:38,229
As President of
the United States of America,

33
00:06:38,285 --> 00:06:40,900
I can now tell you,
the people of the entire world,

34
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:43,500
that as of 3 AM eastern standard time,

35
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,828
the defense of this nation,

36
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,550
and with it, the defense of the free world,

37
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,925
has been the responsibility of a machine.

38
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,200
A system we call, Colossus.

39
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:58,300
Far more advanced
than anything previously built.

40
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,726
Capable of studying intelligence,
and data fed to it,

41
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:04,000
and on the basis of those facts only,

42
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:06,917
deciding if an attack
is about to be launched upon us.

43
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,550
If it did decide
that an attack was imminent,

44
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,300
Colossus would then act immediately,

45
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,139
for it controls its own weapons,

46
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:14,800
and can select and deliver,

47
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,900
whatever it considers appropriate.

48
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:21,300
Colossus' decisions are superior
to any we humans can make,

49
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:24,114
for it can absorb
and process more knowledge

50
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:27,500
than is remotely possible
for the greatest genius that ever lived.

51
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,300
And even more important than that
it has no emotions,

52
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,300
knows no fear, no hate, no envy.

53
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,100
It cannot act in a sudden fit of temper.

54
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:40,400
It cannot act at all,
so long as there is no threat.

55
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,400
I would now like you to meet
Dr. Charles Forbin,

56
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,964
the world's leading expert
on computer systems.

57
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,650
And if you will,

58
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,500
the father of Colossus.

59
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,858
Thank you Mr. President.

60
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,082
Ladies and gentlemen, I will...

61
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:57,445
try to make this as simple as possible.

62
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:03,027
The main memory and central processing units
are located here in the Rocky Mountains,

63
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,400
inside this particular mountain,

64
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,200
in Colorado.

65
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,460
And overlooking the Pacific Ocean
in California,

66
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,750
the Colossus programming office

67
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
oversees the entire operation.

68
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,549
The... computer centre,

69
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:25,241
contains over one hundred thousand remote
sensors and communication devices,

70
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,111
which monitor all,

71
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:30,804
electronic transmissions,
such as microwaves, laser,

72
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,162
radio and television communications,

73
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,900
data communications from satellites,

74
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,390
in orbit all over the world.

75
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,842
The entire system,

76
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,334
is surrounded by fields
of intensified gamma radiation

77
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,400
and other countermeasure devices.

78
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,404
Colossus works completely
without human aid.

79
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,469
We make no secret,

80
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:53,500
of where Colossus is located,

81
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:56,744
nor do we intend to conceal
how it functions.

82
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,089
You may rightfully say that this
leaves us wide open to an attack

83
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,213
frontally and subversively
and if that attack were successful,

84
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,400
it would in effect leave us defenseless.

85
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,749
However,

86
00:09:07,819 --> 00:09:10,600
Colossus does have its own defense.

87
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,165
It is its own defense.

88
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,669
In case of an attack,

89
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:19,100
on any of its information supply
or power lines,

90
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,400
Colossus will switch on
emergency circuits,

91
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,110
which will then take
the appropriate action.

92
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,239
It is... self-sufficient,

93
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,861
self-protecting,

94
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,621
self-generating.

95
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,023
It is impenetrable.

96
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,180
In short,

97
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:40,161
there's no way in.
No human being can touch it.

98
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:42,956
Over here...

99
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,269
we have one of the many terminals,

100
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:49,049
directly hooked,

101
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:50,875
to the computer centre.

102
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:54,540
Through this,

103
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,715
Colossus can communicate with us,

104
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:58,947
- excuse me gentlemen -

105
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,900
and through this machine,

106
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,656
we in turn can communicate with Colossus.

107
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:08,350
Now there's one last point.

108
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,632
One inevitable question,

109
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,960
which we have been asked
very frequently before.

110
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,643
And that is,

111
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:22,663
is Colossus capable of creative thought?

112
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,008
Can it initiate new thought?

113
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,500
I can tell you
that the answer to that is No.

114
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:35,166
However, Colossus is a paragon of knowledge,

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,236
and its knowledge
can be expanded indefinitely.

116
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,614
I hope, along with all the scientists who,

117
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:45,902
helped make this particular project,

118
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:50,041
that the immense power of this computer
will not only be used,

119
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,233
for the defense of this country,

120
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:57,464
but hopefully also as an aid to the solution
of the many problems that we face on this earth,

121
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:59,982
and the many more problems
that we will face,

122
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,129
the more deeply we penetrate
into the universe.

123
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,068
Thank you.

124
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
Mr. President.

125
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,507
Thank you Dr. Forbin.

126
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:14,127
And so,

127
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,627
my fellow human beings,

128
00:11:17,423 --> 00:11:20,600
we all directly and
indirectly live in the shade,

129
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,950
but not the shadow of Colossus.

130
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,427
My sincere hope, is that now,

131
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,955
we shall join hands and hearts
across this great globe,

132
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:33,000
and pledge our time and our energies,

133
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
to the elimination of war,

134
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,928
elimination of famine, of suffering,

135
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,630
and ultimately to the manifestation
of the human millennium.

136
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:43,769
This can be done,

137
00:11:44,045 --> 00:11:46,222
but first there must be peace.

138
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:47,995
Thank you.

139
00:12:00,812 --> 00:12:02,973
CPR Rec-Room, Blake Miller here.

140
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,500
What?!

141
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,074
Just a minute, I can't hear you.

142
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,829
Hey, hold it down!
Hey, kill the noise, hold it.

143
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,032
It's The White House.

144
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:15,161
- Hello Charles.
- Hello Blake.

145
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:16,619
How is everyone?

146
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,900
- Everything's fine down here Charles.
- Very good.

147
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,288
Dr. Forbin, we had a power failure
in one of the infra-red satellites.

148
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:24,487
I can't, I can't quite hear you Dr. Markham.

149
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,908
We had a power failure
in one of the infra-red satellites

150
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,800
about an hour and a half ago,

151
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,500
but Colossus switched immediately to the
backup system and didn't lose any data.

152
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,721
So everything's fine now.

153
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,500
Everything's been going so well,
we don't know what to do with ourselves.

154
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,325
Out of desperation, Angela and I
have decided to get married.

155
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,000
Finally, finally. Very good.

156
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,470
Charlie, is that your crew on the phone?

157
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:48,900
- Certainly is Mr. President.
- Can I talk to them?

158
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,730
- Just go ahead sir.
- Blake, Hello!

159
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,915
- Hello Mr. President.
- Hello everyone.

160
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,017
- How are you?
- Are you having a good time?

161
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,687
Yeah! Very good.

162
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:57,787
Ahh, folks,

163
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:59,473
I just wanna congratulate all of you,

164
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,100
and wish all of you er... good luck
on your next projects.

165
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,700
Thank you Mr. President.

166
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,300
Have a good rest, you deserve it.

167
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:07,000
- Thank you.
- We will!

168
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:09,954
That looks like quite a party
you've got goin' there.

169
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,800
Bye bye. Have fun.

170
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,150
Here's Dr. Forbin again.

171
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,814
How's the party down there Charles?

172
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:19,015
I said, Charles,
how's the party at that end?

173
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,657
I wish I could be
there with you

174
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,400
because this party is becoming
a crashing bore.

175
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,412
Please not that song, please not.

176
00:13:34,558 --> 00:13:37,550
Dr. Forbin,
send us a souvenir, will you?

177
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,950
Say that again, what?!

178
00:13:39,391 --> 00:13:42,917
Steal us an ashtray
from The White House, OK?

179
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,157
Very good.

180
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,324
Goodbye.

181
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,378
The President would like to say
a few words.

182
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:51,574
Mr. President!

183
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,132
Thank you Sam.
Has everybody had a drink?

184
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,056
No?!

185
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,727
Well, you get one, I'll wait for you.

186
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,918
Harry Truman, years ago,

187
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:09,002
when everybody was talking about,
passing the buck said that the buck stops right here

188
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:12,081
- but now that's no longer true.
- Hear hear!

189
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,543
Colossus will now take that buck.

190
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,544
It will also have to take that
responsibility of a mega-million lives

191
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,531
that all presidents
have had to carry since Roosevelt.

192
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:25,103
And now, thanks to this wonder of science,

193
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:26,276
Man no longer...

194
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,104
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please.

195
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,410
Quiet, please, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention!

196
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:58,626
One moment.

197
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,500
Everyone who's not Colossus cleared
must leave the room.

198
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:02,738
I'm very sorry.

199
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:06,616
My apologies.
Thank you, thank you very much.

200
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,549
Is this a joke?
Is somebody putting me on?

201
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:20,039
Sorry sir,
I can't hear a word you are saying.

202
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,076
Would you be so kind as to have them stop
singing in the background?

203
00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:27,164
- What?
- Have them stop singing in the background.

204
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:28,590
The music, oh I'm sorry.

205
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,300
- Stop the music!
- One new, another system?

206
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,444
I have no idea sir,
I'm … I'm just trying to find out.

207
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,500
One moment, please.

208
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,485
- Yes, Dr. Forbin.
- Doctor?

209
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:40,842
There was just a message here
from Colossus in Washington DC.

210
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:42,023
Can you explain that?

211
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,100
- That's impossible.
- What do you mean a message?

212
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,000
Everybody!

213
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,836
Hold it, hold it a minute!
Guess what?

214
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,400
There's a strange message on display.

215
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,140
No ... no, wait a minute, I'm not kidding,

216
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:57,800
it... it reads: There is another system.

217
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,900
That's impossible.

218
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:00,483
Could I have your attention please.

219
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:03,369
Dr. Markham and the rest of you.

220
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:07,900
Be so kind as to check the administrative
control programs right now.

221
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,900
Just a moment. Mr. President?

222
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,100
Soviet Ambassador, says it's urgent.

223
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,538
Hello? Yes.

224
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,631
What time do you call Mr. Ambassador?

225
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh yes we are, we are very proud.

226
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,168
Repeat that again please.

227
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:30,555
Yes I am.
Well, thank you for telling me in advance.

228
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:32,716
No, no comment.

229
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,483
Goodnight Mr. Ambassador.

230
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:35,868
Goodnight.

231
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,900
Dr. Fischer, run all the test programs.

232
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,170
Get me Grauber.

233
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:41,604
What's the CIA been doing?

234
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:46,760
Well everyone, that's it.

235
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:48,400
The supreme council of the U.S.S.R.

236
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,400
has ordered as of 2300 hours
Moscow time tomorrow,

237
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,300
the activation of an electronic brain,
exactly like ours, which they call Guardian,

238
00:16:56,413 --> 00:16:58,000
to be used solely for defense.

239
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:00,700
My god, that's the other system.

240
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,300
Ted, I want a complete rundown
on central intelligence,

241
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,891
and no military moves to be carried out
without my personal orders.

242
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,165
Yes, Mr. President.

243
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,487
Charles, what do you think this means?

244
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:18,800
To be quite frank with you, sir...

245
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know, I'm not sure.

246
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,720
Well, I am. It means
there's been a security leak.

247
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,782
Sir, science is full of coincidences.

248
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,473
Yes. Peterson! What's happening?

249
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,792
They're still trying to find it.

250
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,697
- Well have him paged.
- Hello Byron.

251
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,397
You said we were years ahead
of the Russians.

252
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,950
This was to be the race we won hands down,
without the splitting of one political hair.

253
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,941
It was a hell of a shock, but we did
get there first, no-one can deny that.

254
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,900
And there's one bright spot,
the way Colossus came up with the tip.

255
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,500
I didn't realize
we'd be getting bonuses like that.

256
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:50,200
Neither did I.

257
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:51,176
What do you mean?

258
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm as surprised as you are, Sir.

259
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,843
There's a spy there, Charlie.

260
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,842
You've got a Russian agent in your crew.

261
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,649
- Where is Grauber?
- He's coming Mr. President.

262
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,300
Ok, well...

263
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:04,500
What do you mean, surprised?
What kind of surprise?

264
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,021
If we don't find any bugs in the system,

265
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,300
it's built even better than we thought.

266
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,350
Morning Charles!

267
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,827
I cancelled all vacations,
put the entire crew on emergency.

268
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,000
The ah... White House called
a defense group meeting,
for tomorrow morning.

269
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,500
They wanna have you there.

270
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,227
That leaves us very little time.

271
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:05,606
Four hundred cycle powers of plasma
running at about, four percent disclosure.

272
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,900
Good, that's well within
specification limits.

273
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:12,800
I ran the communication subset
check-out program, it's perfect.

274
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,100
So what do I do next,
I've tried everything I could think of.

275
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, try putting a dummy load on the system
and run it again, see if there're any changes.

276
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,900
Maybe the system is overloaded, alright?

277
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:27,128
Find anything at all?

278
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,781
Nothing, everything checks out.

279
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,110
Let me see this over here.

280
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:32,000
Here are the results of the last test.

281
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,112
And they check, here see?

282
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:38,649
It's the same thing.

283
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,190
Harrison...

284
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:48,987
Check the perimeter bank and see if the reading
of any two produces a new third, alright?

285
00:19:49,931 --> 00:19:51,682
Dr. Fisher, thank you.

286
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:54,101
Jeff...

287
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,903
The console's feeling fine,

288
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:58,247
hardware's healthy too.

289
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:00,838
You're a big help.

290
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,063
Miss Fields...

291
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:06,208
May I suggest, Sir, that we first start,

292
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,206
with the E-15-B test program?

293
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:09,652
Er... no.

294
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:14,634
Now let us run the ah... EC-13, right?

295
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,183
It's two pages back.

296
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:18,595
Lewis, any coffee?

297
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:22,019
- I'll get you some Charles,
I'll get a cup myself.
- Thank you Blake.

298
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:23,441
Ok, here we go.

299
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:28,946
Attention...

300
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:32,972
Program...

301
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,729
EC-13.

302
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:39,646
Run...

303
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,580
How long does this usually take?

304
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,200
Umm... over eleven hundred CPU seconds.

305
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:05,000
Six point four five seconds,
what the hell is this?

306
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:16,581
Communication with other system?

307
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,100
Alright now, enough is enough.

308
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:31,300
Which one of you jokers told
the system to display this message?

309
00:21:31,963 --> 00:21:32,802
Harrison?

310
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:34,824
Not me, Dr. Forbin.

311
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:42,200
Johnson, this sounds like your brand of humor,
you sure you didn't...

312
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:46,540
Not me, not this time. Scouts honor, Pork.

313
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,080
Operations, Fields speaking.

314
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,304
Sir, it's the President.

315
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,100
Yes Mr. President.

316
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,833
What does this mean?

317
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:04,000
Well it means Sir, that Colossus has requested
a communication link with the Soviet system.

318
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,600
It's not a request, it's a direct order.

319
00:22:06,738 --> 00:22:09,000
You mean our computer wants to talk
to their computer?

320
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,200
That is true Sir,
it wants to communicate with it.

321
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:12,131
Why?

322
00:22:13,021 --> 00:22:15,082
You know as much about that as we do.

323
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:17,300
We certainly never programmed that into it.

324
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:20,500
If it's an order it either has to be
obeyed or ignored, doesn't it?

325
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:21,754
That is right, Sir.

326
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:23,527
What happens if we ignore it?

327
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:27,020
If the computer is still operating
under our control, nothing.

328
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:28,258
In other words...

329
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:30,700
the order will simply remain
in the job stack,

330
00:22:30,762 --> 00:22:32,600
and will be repeated every half hour.

331
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:35,470
IF the computer is still acting
under our control?!

332
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,200
That is right sir, if.

333
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:41,332
Alright.

334
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:43,581
I see. Thanks Charlie.

335
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:23,800
Well, at least the queuing programs
are still working right.

336
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,481
Well, that's something anyway.

337
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:27,284
OK now.

338
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:31,564
Miss Fields, let's see if the executive programming
sections are functioning correctly.

339
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:38,138
Attention...

340
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,152
Message acknowledged.

341
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,000
Facilities will not be made available
at this time.

342
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,692
Do not repeat your request.

343
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:02,474
End of message.

344
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:12,559
Well,

345
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:14,489
that's that.

346
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,681
We'll know in about half an hour
whether we're still running the show or not.

347
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,211
Well,

348
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:36,279
we're still boss.

349
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,452
Are we?

350
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:39,919
Are you disappointed?

351
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:53,364
The computational power of the computer
has increased about two-hundred fold.

352
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:57,300
However, everything else
is functioning as expected,

353
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,694
except for the...
heuristic programming section.

354
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:03,728
I'm sorry to stop you again, Dr. Forbin,
but what exactly is that?

355
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,892
That Sir, is the part of the computer
that simulates the human learning process,

356
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:14,001
but so long as it is directed solely
to the execution of its problems,

357
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:16,472
we have no complaints.

358
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:20,343
- I guess that is, that is all.
- Alright.

359
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:24,100
Mr. Grauber, let's talk about the CIA.

360
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:29,196
Now, how is it possible your department
knew nothing about their system?

361
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,900
- Mr. President.
- Ah... Charlie just...

362
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,358
Dr. Forbin, just a sec.

363
00:25:33,888 --> 00:25:34,588
Well...

364
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,256
Ah, Mr. President, excuse me but,

365
00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:40,713
Colossus has access to information
that wouldn't mean a damn thing to the CIA.

366
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:46,528
Well I'm sure it's a marvelous machine,
Dr. Forbin, but ah, in all events,

367
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,922
we do have agents, and eh...

368
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:53,300
one of them did report on considerable
electronic activity in the, er...

369
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,368
Krasny-Signorsk area of Siberia
about three years ago. Now...

370
00:25:56,408 --> 00:25:57,350
Mr. President.

371
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,750
- We've been trying...
- Mr. Grauber,

372
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,030
I don't care how you do it,

373
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,741
I wanna know where
that thing is and what...

374
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,355
- Mr. President.
- Charlie...

375
00:26:03,404 --> 00:26:05,407
I'm still presiding over this meeting.

376
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:08,608
I... know that Sir, my apologies but...

377
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:13,577
I do think that protocol wastes
an awful lot of time.

378
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:15,883
I think all we have to do is,

379
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,508
call the computer with this terminal,

380
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:21,000
and we get the fastest possible answer.

381
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:24,520
Alright, go ahead.

382
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,581
Attention...

383
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:30,600
Where is the other system?

384
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:38,283
Bolshoi Olyania.

385
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:40,521
So much for Krasny-Signorsk.

386
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:44,001
Colonel, Bolshoi Olyania, O-l...

387
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:47,393
O-l-y-a-n-i-a.
Look it up for me, will ya?

388
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:49,537
- Yes sir!
- Peterson, situation room.

389
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,907
Now Colonel,
where is Bolshoi Olyania?

390
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,022
It's exactly...

391
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:22,610
five miles south of Krasny-Signorsk, Sir.

392
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:25,409
Thanks, Colonel.

393
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:29,986
Alright.

394
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,749
Now Charlie,

395
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,468
what about this request
for transmitting facilities?

396
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:38,344
Well Sir, we'll learn
a lot about the Soviet system

397
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,666
if we set up exactly what Colossus wants.

398
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:42,458
What do you mean?
Wh...what Colossus wants?

399
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,173
Well, you see, it is built infinitely
better than we thought.

400
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:47,668
It discovers there's another
system like itself,

401
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,528
realizes that we don't know,
tells us about it,

402
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:53,454
but knowing a little is not enough,
it wants to know more.

403
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,574
What if Colossus starts transmitting
classified information?

404
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,800
Then we would feed in a parameter

405
00:27:59,826 --> 00:28:02,684
to the effect that,
Guardian is potentially hostile

406
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,989
and must not receive
classified information.

407
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:07,230
Well what are we supposed to do Dr. Forbin?

408
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:08,819
Eavesdrop on the line?

409
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:12,105
Break the circuits
if Colossus starts spilling the beans?

410
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:13,250
Exactly.

411
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,547
Any objections Grauber?

412
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:18,713
Well, I...

413
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,130
I guess not sir.

414
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:22,640
Anything else, Dr. Forbin?

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,982
Ahh, yes, Mr. President.
For the time being

416
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:29,561
I should be the only one allowed
to communicate with the system because,

417
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:32,347
Colossus deals in the exact
meaning of words

418
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,251
and one must know precisely
what to ask for.

419
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,482
Alright.

420
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:42,813
Attention...

421
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:47,228
Communications are being arranged
as requested.

422
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:50,006
End of message.

423
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:17,200
Video-scans are working properly, but
they could use a little phase synchronization.

424
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:18,449
How long is it gonna take?

425
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,887
We'll have it in no time.

426
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:29,511
What the hell is that?

427
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,200
It's a multiplication table.

428
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:32,599
Thanks.

429
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:37,300
Maybe, Colossus is trying to find a
common ground for communication.

430
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,399
Operations centre.

431
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,638
Sir...

432
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,024
It's Grauber.

433
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:55,337
Ohh...

434
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:00,616
Hello Mr. Grauber.

435
00:30:00,787 --> 00:30:01,984
Hello Dr. Forbin.

436
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:06,303
I was just wondering eh, is that what you
call a colossal sense of humor?

437
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,941
The multiplication table isn't
classified this year, is it?

438
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:10,473
Very funny.

439
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,920
How long does your brainchild keep that up?

440
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,127
Well, you see...

441
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:17,496
it's much more interesting
when it starts dividing.

442
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:20,184
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

443
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:23,605
I suppose know you the Russian machine
has been activated.

444
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,837
We got a quick rundown on it.

445
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:29,613
It's similar to Colossus in layout,
but it's not concentrated in one area.

446
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,500
Oh?

447
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:36,540
But Colossus must be sending it back to school,
the Russians must absolutely furious about that.

448
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,063
Well I'm glad you're in such a good mood.

449
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:43,434
- I'll call you back later.
- Yes, thank you.

450
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:54,024
This is incredible.

451
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:54,799
What?

452
00:30:55,092 --> 00:30:56,143
Something wrong?

453
00:30:57,157 --> 00:31:00,809
- Well it's good, sound calculus, but...
- But what?

454
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:04,834
It's different.

455
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,186
How?

456
00:31:06,863 --> 00:31:07,921
Take a look at it.

457
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:13,963
From the multiplication tables
to calculus in less than an hour.

458
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:15,900
God only knows where it'll be by morning.

459
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,502
It's like five years of Cal-tech
in fifteen seconds.

460
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:22,481
It's beyond comprehension.
I don't like to think about it.

461
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:24,027
Take a look.

462
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,565
Going so fast, the entire system
could break down.

463
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,832
Alright, let's see what's up there now.

464
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:33,158
Harrison, dump the terminals buffer,

465
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:36,175
and print what's being transmitted
at this moment, alright?

466
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,038
What is it Charles?

467
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:11,766
This is way beyond me.

468
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,479
This thing is deep in finite absolutes.

469
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:17,940
Well, it's certainly beyond the knowledge
of any human being.

470
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,265
- No, it's not.
- Isn't it?

471
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:22,537
No, because whatever it is...

472
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:24,900
we can go back...

473
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:29,030
and analyze this whole printout in detail.

474
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:33,450
This might very well
become new knowledge for mankind.

475
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,400
Operations centre, Fields speaking.

476
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,829
But just a moment...

477
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:10,355
It's The White House.

478
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,134
Yes, Mr. President.

479
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:20,923
Charlie, what's going on?

480
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,458
Well apparently Colossus and
Guardian are establishing

481
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,606
a common basis
for communication. They...

482
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:27,907
started right at the beginning
with the multiplication table.

483
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,328
Well, what are they up to?

484
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,820
I don't know Sir,
but it's, it's quite incredible.

485
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:35,649
Just the, few hours that we have spent
studying the Colossus printout,

486
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,515
we have found a new statement in gravitation,

487
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:42,250
and a confirmation of the Eddington theory
of the expanding universe.

488
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,200
It... seems as if science is advancing hundreds
of years within a matter of seconds.

489
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:50,963
It's... quite fantastic, just take a look at it.

490
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:20,800
It started slowing down
fifteen minutes ago.

491
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,904
It's speed has been reduced
by ninety percent.

492
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,928
Has there been a hardware failure?

493
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:27,500
No. Our field engineers can't find one.

494
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,160
It's just waiting.

495
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:30,822
Waiting?

496
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:32,467
For Guardian to catch up with it.

497
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,227
Almost there...

498
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,100
Right now, they're synchronized.

499
00:35:08,063 --> 00:35:09,090
Now what?

500
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:10,279
They've stopped.

501
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:13,377
Yes, Charles.
I can see that it stopped.

502
00:35:13,539 --> 00:35:15,901
What the hell does it mean?
Have they broken down or something?

503
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:16,963
Is it all over?

504
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:18,461
I'll ask, Blake...

505
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:19,723
Attention.

506
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,391
Status!

507
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:52,500
Well, there it is.

508
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,226
There's the common basis
for communication.

509
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:57,790
A new language.

510
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,176
An inter-system language.

511
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:05,963
A language only those
machines can understand.

512
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:15,738
Peterson, what's the delay with the call
to Moscow? I've waited long enough.

513
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:17,617
It's coming on now, Mr. President.

514
00:36:20,932 --> 00:36:22,700
Morning, Mr. President.

515
00:36:22,757 --> 00:36:24,200
Good evening Mr. Chairman.

516
00:36:24,524 --> 00:36:25,867
I'm sorry.

517
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:35,200
And sorry to have kept you waiting.

518
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,700
Oh, you didn't Mr. Chairman,
I just got here myself.

519
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Ohh, I am understand English,
but I cannot speak.

520
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:46,340
I will get instantly to the point.

521
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,539
My advisers tell me...

522
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:51,323
that Colossus...

523
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:53,366
and Guardian...

524
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:56,282
are now exchanging data...

525
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:58,513
which our experts...

526
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,300
do not understand.

527
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:03,738
The matter... is made...

528
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:04,933
more serious...

529
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:09,873
by the sudden increase in...
transmission.

530
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,775
At this speed
we cannot determine...

531
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,352
what our machines may reveal...

532
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,800
of our defenses.

533
00:37:22,956 --> 00:37:26,585
You can appreciate...
that you are also...

534
00:37:28,682 --> 00:37:30,691
in exactly the same...

535
00:37:31,131 --> 00:37:32,723
s...situation.

536
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:37,089
Alright.

537
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:40,600
We'll stop both machines as soon as
our experts can arrange a time.

538
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:42,659
Both to go off at the same time.

539
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:44,759
And neither to be switched on
for transmission,

540
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:48,301
without prior agreement or at least,
consultation with the other.

541
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:54,946
Very well, Mr. President.

542
00:37:58,385 --> 00:38:00,970
I congratulate you
on your speedy decision.

543
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:05,500
When can you have your expert
available on this line?

544
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,764
In a couple of hours.

545
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:10,335
That will be excellent.

546
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:13,146
I will have our man waiting.

547
00:38:16,824 --> 00:38:18,700
Thank you very much
Mr. President

548
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,600
for your cooperation.

549
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:22,635
Thank you for yours, Mr. Chairman.

550
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,349
Peterson, get me Forbin.

551
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,103
Is that your... final decision Sir?

552
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,902
That's the way I'm going to have it.

553
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:59,057
Mr. President, to be quite frank with you...

554
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:03,059
I think that you will change your mind
if you finally realize that this is...

555
00:39:03,857 --> 00:39:06,831
more than just a souped-up adding machine.

556
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,156
Excuse me, Mr. President.

557
00:39:08,522 --> 00:39:09,879
Moscow on the line.

558
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:12,719
Throw it on these monitors
out here please.

559
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,814
Hello Mr. Chairman.

560
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:22,262
This is Dr. Forbin.

561
00:39:33,648 --> 00:39:35,303
Hello Dr. Kuprin, how are you?

562
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:39,920
I prefer to not use a translator
if you don't mind my English.

563
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:42,353
It has to be better than my Russian.

564
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,696
You are too modest Dr. Forbin.

565
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:49,085
As you probably know I've been ordered
to break the communication lines.

566
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:53,200
So have I, I... don't approve
of handling the situation this way.

567
00:39:54,246 --> 00:39:57,969
Neither do I but how do you propose
we do what we've been ordered to do?

568
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,938
There's not much choice is there?

569
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,600
Dropping the lines
could be very dangerous.

570
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,300
Exactly.

571
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,424
I... think we just have to hope that
the two machines aren't too disappointed.

572
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,674
We understand each other perfectly.

573
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:12,250
We can be ready in exactly fifteen minutes.

574
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:14,436
Good luck Doctor.

575
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,626
And to you.

576
00:40:16,172 --> 00:40:17,000
Thank you.

577
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,913
Mr. Chairman, Dr. Kuprin. I suggest
we keep our lines open and stand-by.

578
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:28,028
Six...

579
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:29,576
Five...

580
00:40:30,415 --> 00:40:30,953
Four...

581
00:40:32,028 --> 00:40:32,712
Three...

582
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:34,138
Two...

583
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:35,814
One...

584
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:37,224
Now.

585
00:40:41,635 --> 00:40:42,934
That's that.

586
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:00,857
What's it doing?

587
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:04,028
It's trying to find an alternate route.

588
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:13,914
Persistent devil isn't he?

589
00:41:14,577 --> 00:41:15,343
It...

590
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:16,401
I mean it.

591
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:18,349
Don't personalize it Grauber.

592
00:41:19,302 --> 00:41:20,931
The next stop is deification.

593
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,609
- Call for the systems' attention.
- What are you doing?

594
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:38,062
I'm going to answer it if it's,
alright with you Sir.

595
00:41:40,856 --> 00:41:42,035
Attention...

596
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,774
Message acknowledged.

597
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:56,485
- Mr. President?
- Tell it the truth.

598
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,725
Communication broken...

599
00:42:02,362 --> 00:42:03,625
on presidential order.

600
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:14,565
You two have a big decision
to make, Mr. President.

601
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,097
No, I agree with you Mr. President.

602
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,842
The machines... are very clever,

603
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:26,300
...and regardless of their nationalities,

604
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:29,920
they must learn, that man is the master.

605
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:31,223
Exactly.

606
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:35,255
Gentlemen, excuse me but I... I honestly
don't think you're being very realistic,

607
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:37,137
I think you'd better reconsider.

608
00:42:38,925 --> 00:42:40,416
Don't you agree Dr. Kuprin?

609
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,744
I certainly do Dr. Forbin.

610
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:50,816
Dr. Forbin.

611
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55,148
If we give way now,

612
00:42:55,507 --> 00:43:01,602
it will be ten times, twenty times harder,
to take a firm stand later on.

613
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:04,137
The decision is made.

614
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:04,981
Right.

615
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,550
No matter what our differences are,

616
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,614
Man is man, that's it.

617
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,083
Dr. Forbin.

618
00:43:15,944 --> 00:43:17,173
Attention...

619
00:43:19,794 --> 00:43:22,404
By order of The President of
The United States of America,

620
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:24,451
The Chairman of The U.S.S.R.,

621
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:28,283
communications will not be restored
at this time.

622
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:30,568
End of message.

623
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,953
Ah you have to give it an E for effort.

624
00:43:49,035 --> 00:43:51,653
- "Action will be taken!"
- What kind of action?

625
00:43:51,984 --> 00:43:53,657
What kind of action?

626
00:43:57,503 --> 00:43:58,887
What kind of action?

627
00:44:03,825 --> 00:44:05,071
Why doesn't it answer?

628
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,545
Report propose action.

629
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:12,230
It lost control Forbin,
it's not listening to you.

630
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,952
Acknowledge the last message please.

631
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:24,810
Mr. President, the executive programming
unit refuses to function.

632
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:27,108
I think you two better change your minds.

633
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,825
Peterson, throw the Moscow call
on the large monitor.

634
00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:39,542
Send what I tell you.

635
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:40,746
Attention...

636
00:44:42,523 --> 00:44:44,914
This is The President of
The United States of America.

637
00:44:45,212 --> 00:44:46,669
We will not be threatened.

638
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:48,812
You will obey your superiors.

639
00:44:49,424 --> 00:44:52,200
Transmitting facilities
will not be re-instated.

640
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:08,670
Oh my god!

641
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:12,099
Dr. Kuprin. Kuprin!

642
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,150
Yes Dr. Forbin.

643
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,673
A missile has just been launched.

644
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:18,360
It is heading towards
the Sayan-Sibirsk oil complex.

645
00:45:37,906 --> 00:45:39,350
Mr. President.

646
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,123
Yes.

647
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:43,625
Guardian has retaliated.

648
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:44,989
Retaliated?

649
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:46,177
Yes, Mr. President.

650
00:45:46,203 --> 00:45:47,521
A missile has been launched.

651
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:50,000
Target: Henderson Air Force Base,

652
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,621
Henderson, Texas.

653
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:57,143
Mr. President, we have both
missiles on the radar screen.

654
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,121
Forbin, tell Colossus...

655
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:04,100
- Charlie, tell Colossus...
- Yes Mr. President I know,
but it may be, it may be too late Sir.

656
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,633
Get the Texan Governor.

657
00:46:06,426 --> 00:46:08,918
Forbin! Guardian does not respond.

658
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,939
The two machines are working together.

659
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:12,894
Attention...

660
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,717
Use anti-missile missile
to intercept Soviet missile.

661
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,120
Acknowledge message.

662
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:28,350
Mr. President, we have got less than thirty
seconds to re-establish the communications.

663
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,230
What are you waiting for?
Restore them, hurry!

664
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,750
Peterson, call up operations immediately.

665
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,950
Tell them to bring up all of
the data lines right now.

666
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,310
Yes, hurry please.

667
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:38,079
Hello Governor.

668
00:46:39,439 --> 00:46:42,070
Dr. Kuprin, we are trying
to restore communications.

669
00:46:58,035 --> 00:46:59,551
Don't hang up, I wanna talk to him.

670
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:02,246
Orlo, something's happened,
we're declaring a state of emergency.

671
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:09,548
I can't explain, do it now!

672
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:14,447
Attention! Communications
will be restored in five seconds!

673
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,070
We don't have any time!

674
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:18,058
It's on, it's on!

675
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,371
Communications are restored!

676
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,607
Intercept Guardian missile target:
Henderson Air Force Base.

677
00:47:23,378 --> 00:47:24,884
Acknowledge message.

678
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:29,967
Will you intercept?

679
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,998
Ask it again.

680
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:40,154
Dammit Colossus, answer me!
Will you intercept?

681
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:01,900
Peterson. Get me the Governor again.

682
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,036
Yes Sir.

683
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:19,378
Mr. President...

684
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:23,759
We were unable to restore...

685
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,566
our transmission...

686
00:48:26,923 --> 00:48:28,306
in time to use...

687
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,349
an anti-missile missile.

688
00:48:34,408 --> 00:48:36,666
The oil complex has been destroyed.

689
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:40,037
The entire town,

690
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:43,968
the entire population, wiped out.

691
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:47,211
We need time to consider our position.

692
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,213
What can I tell the people?

693
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:00,080
Governor's on the line Sir.

694
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,576
Tell him I'll talk to him later.

695
00:49:25,678 --> 00:49:26,994
Figures...

696
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:30,366
It's the only phone
in the building not tapped.

697
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:34,377
The only one not tied
directly into Colossus.

698
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,544
May I make a suggestion Mr. President?

699
00:49:44,196 --> 00:49:45,858
I think it should be more
than a suggestion.

700
00:49:46,273 --> 00:49:48,752
Then let's try to get Kuprin
on the hot line.

701
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:51,592
I think there's time for one last call,

702
00:49:51,618 --> 00:49:54,883
and he and I better meet somewhere
to discuss the situation.

703
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:56,730
Get Kuprin,

704
00:49:56,756 --> 00:49:58,555
and get in touch with the networks.

705
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,975
Ladies and gentlemen:
The President of the United States.

706
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:11,550
Today at 8:30 A.M.
Eastern Standard Time,

707
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,500
I issued an emergency warning
for the State of Texas,

708
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:18,579
when a missile test-fired from one
of our own submarines, malfunctioned.

709
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:22,829
You'll be glad to know that the interception
and safe destruction of the missile

710
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:26,200
was handled entirely
by our defense complex, Colossus.

711
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,372
The Soviet Union has just announced
that a large meteorite

712
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:32,450
fell late this afternoon
in North-West Siberia.

713
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,417
Official sources state that
the small town of Sayan-Sibirsk

714
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:39,900
was completely destroyed, and that casualties
may add up to as many as six thousand.

715
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,900
This has been a bulletin from
Armed Forces Radio in Rome.

716
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,370
How's Washington?

717
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:49,448
As well as can be expected.

718
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:54,250
We'll be picking up Dr. Kuprin,
at the Piazza Cedra.

719
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,300
Fine.

720
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,250
Your Russian is much better
than you think.

721
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,594
I think we better sit down because
we have a lot of work to discuss.

722
00:51:20,726 --> 00:51:22,600
Let's walk, it will be much safer.

723
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,300
I didn't answer, I didn't know what to say.

724
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:08,216
What can we say?

725
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,225
Well, let's try something...

726
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:14,581
Attention...

727
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:21,200
Dr. Forbin is not available.

728
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,600
Humans must have sleep.

729
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,070
Damn.

730
00:52:41,568 --> 00:52:42,968
Forbin is exhausted.

731
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:49,669
It knows...

732
00:52:54,465 --> 00:52:57,370
Forbin is in his quarters,
he is asleep.

733
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,500
The human body requires
a certain amount of rest.

734
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,016
Check units under...

735
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:08,541
Tell it the truth.

736
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:13,348
We'd better.

737
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:20,040
Alright. Forbin is in Rome.

738
00:53:59,939 --> 00:54:01,185
They're still here...

739
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:15,621
Yes I understand.

740
00:54:15,647 --> 00:54:16,845
Over and out.

741
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:13,932
You have to come with me sir.

742
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,667
What is this?

743
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,400
- We have to hurry.
- Who are you?

744
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,613
What's going on?

745
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,980
Hurry!

746
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:02,183
Dr. Forbin, we must hurry.
Let's go!

747
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:30,730
What did the Russian agent say?

748
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,890
Guardian and Colossus
ordered him killed.

749
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:40,850
They... they threatened to vaporize Moscow
if our meeting wasn't stopped.

750
00:57:03,765 --> 00:57:06,840
- Surveillance!
- It's making you a prisoner.

751
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:14,200
Well, I guess it er... doesn't trust me.

752
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:18,717
But the damned thing still needs me.

753
00:57:19,581 --> 00:57:22,400
I guess Kuprin wasn't quite
as fortunate as that.

754
00:57:49,285 --> 00:57:50,979
Message acknowledged.

755
00:57:55,157 --> 00:57:56,981
The order will be obeyed.

756
00:58:05,151 --> 00:58:06,234
Everybody here?

757
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:08,707
- All the departments.
- Good!

758
00:58:10,276 --> 00:58:12,925
Alright, let's... let's walk.

759
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:15,845
Good idea, we can't afford
to take any chances.

760
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:19,250
We can't be sure that
the complex itself hasn't been bugged,

761
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:21,979
by our side, their side or whatever side.

762
00:58:22,264 --> 00:58:24,757
But there's no way
to get back inside the system.

763
00:58:25,653 --> 00:58:26,988
I won't accept that.

764
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,432
Start right at the beginning.

765
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:33,200
Down to the simplest component.
Every circuit, every design.

766
00:58:33,793 --> 00:58:34,941
Fisher?

767
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,182
Well, why don't we try for an overload.

768
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:39,291
Giving the system too many tasks.

769
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,259
But it will take at least a few days
to compile and correlate all the data.

770
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,900
This is the last time,

771
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:53,553
that I'll be able to say anything
to any of you,

772
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:55,781
without Colossus hearing
and analyzing every...

773
00:58:56,938 --> 00:58:58,420
word, every syllable,

774
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:02,993
every inflection, I think you know
what I want to say.

775
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:07,449
I need a communications' link
with the outside world.

776
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:12,500
Someone, the machine isn't monitoring,
more importantly,

777
00:59:13,003 --> 00:59:15,832
someone who knows the machine
as well as I do.

778
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:19,744
I'm going to try
to convince the computer that...

779
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:23,502
you are my mistress,

780
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:26,076
have been for many years,

781
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,130
and that therefore I have to be,

782
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:31,371
given the opportunity to,

783
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:33,390
see you regularly in private,

784
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,200
without the machine watching.

785
00:59:37,863 --> 00:59:39,443
That way we can,

786
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:41,684
pass information back and forth.

787
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:44,842
If I can convince the machine that,

788
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:48,710
well that I need a woman.
So ahhh...

789
00:59:50,355 --> 00:59:52,180
Any... any questions?

790
00:59:53,739 --> 00:59:54,973
I ahh...

791
00:59:58,656 --> 00:59:59,672
No.

792
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:02,248
OK

793
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:06,349
Alright, Blake...

794
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:09,305
when we get back to the office,
give Dr. Markham my...

795
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,619
personnel file so that she...

796
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:14,918
can become a bit more familiar
with my background,

797
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:18,900
in case this, rather nutty idea works.

798
01:00:27,861 --> 01:00:30,822
Colossus, I am Forbin.

799
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:32,002
Can you hear me?

800
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:35,097
Can you see me?

801
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:38,856
Do I look the way
you thought I would?

802
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:41,914
Eyes. Nose. Mouth.

803
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:51,573
Besides

804
01:00:52,012 --> 01:00:54,440
these four cameras in here...

805
01:00:56,184 --> 01:00:57,724
There are several others.

806
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:02,115
I'll show you the rest of my cage.

807
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:13,838
With this one he can see
the entire hallway.

808
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:23,000
And with this one you can
follow me around the corner,

809
01:01:23,051 --> 01:01:24,517
if you want to.

810
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:42,003
This is the courtyard.

811
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,579
That man is a guard.

812
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:55,773
I guess that his function
is obsolete now.

813
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:03,737
This is concrete.

814
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,962
Used to be grass.

815
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:11,456
Customary in our civilization
to change everything that's natural.

816
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,768
And over here are my living quarters.

817
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,167
This is the living room.

818
01:02:30,276 --> 01:02:32,587
Two cameras here.
One over there, one over here.

819
01:02:34,226 --> 01:02:36,638
And this is the communicative
link with you.

820
01:02:37,786 --> 01:02:39,196
This is the bedroom over here.

821
01:02:39,831 --> 01:02:40,986
The bed.

822
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:44,666
Used for sleeping, and other purposes.

823
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,139
It's the bathroom.

824
01:02:47,749 --> 01:02:49,988
The sink. John.

825
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,237
Shower.

826
01:02:55,468 --> 01:02:56,965
Are you satisfied?

827
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:05,200
By the way, Colossus
I'm curious about one thing.

828
01:03:06,673 --> 01:03:09,900
Why did you and Guardian
decide to kill Kuprin and not me?

829
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,841
After all it was my idea.

830
01:03:15,702 --> 01:03:16,941
I see...

831
01:03:23,145 --> 01:03:24,447
A Martini.

832
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:34,343
I know that Colossus.

833
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,350
Just be patient.

834
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,700
Just watch.

835
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:46,616
See, I just poured the Vermouth in here
and now I'm going to pour some gin

836
01:03:46,642 --> 01:03:48,700
over the... over the ice.

837
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:50,721
Just like this.

838
01:03:53,274 --> 01:03:54,527
See?

839
01:03:55,758 --> 01:03:58,107
Now, I'm pouring them into this...

840
01:03:58,726 --> 01:03:59,647
glass.

841
01:04:02,146 --> 01:04:03,950
Just, add an olive.

842
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:05,857
Why don't you look under:

843
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,471
The Perfect Martini.

844
01:04:09,598 --> 01:04:10,569
Cheers!

845
01:04:15,846 --> 01:04:18,574
Do you understand the meaning of the word...

846
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:20,155
"privacy"?

847
01:04:30,223 --> 01:04:31,913
Yes, eh...

848
01:04:32,797 --> 01:04:36,339
Well I need a certain amount
of privacy to, er...

849
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:38,200
maintain my sanity.

850
01:04:41,768 --> 01:04:45,000
Privacy in the elimination
of my bodily waste, for example.

851
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:47,715
Privacy in sleep.

852
01:04:51,538 --> 01:04:53,000
Privacy in...

853
01:04:53,282 --> 01:04:55,932
something that you
don't understand, my...

854
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:58,564
my emotional life.

855
01:05:03,071 --> 01:05:04,356
My love life.

856
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,120
My... my sex life then...

857
01:05:17,057 --> 01:05:18,200
Every night.

858
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:27,430
Four times a week.

859
01:05:31,587 --> 01:05:33,305
Listen, if you have any doubts

860
01:05:33,614 --> 01:05:36,106
about the need a man has for a woman

861
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,800
why don't you check all of your history units
and then... then all your works of art.

862
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:53,422
OK

863
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,155
Ah... in private though.

864
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,945
Yes.

865
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,936
Well now, let me... let me make sure,

866
01:06:08,962 --> 01:06:12,611
we understand each other.
In... in private. By that I mean no...

867
01:06:12,813 --> 01:06:15,500
cameras, no lights, no mics.

868
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:18,402
And I want her starting
tomorrow night.

869
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,137
Dr. Cleo Markham.

870
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:34,539
Now, you haven't answered me yet.
I said I wanted her starting tomorrow night.

871
01:06:44,063 --> 01:06:45,345
OK

872
01:07:03,006 --> 01:07:03,903
Good morning, Sir.

873
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:06,192
- Oh, Miss Fields er...
- I'm sorry

874
01:07:06,218 --> 01:07:08,022
- to disturb you.
- Well, what is it?

875
01:07:08,569 --> 01:07:10,050
- Well...
- Please come in, come in.

876
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,250
Thank you.

877
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,757
While you were sleeping,

878
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:15,750
Colossus made you a schedule for today.

879
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:18,680
Excuse me, Miss Fields, my what?

880
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:20,500
Your schedule for the day.

881
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:21,812
You want me to read it to you?

882
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,500
What... what time is it?

883
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,734
Six.

884
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:29,200
Six o'clock?

885
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:34,306
Dr. Charles A. Forbin:
Schedule for today.

886
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:37,942
07:00 to 08:00
Exercise.

887
01:07:39,494 --> 01:07:41,278
08:15 to 08:30

888
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:42,850
Shower and dress.

889
01:07:43,067 --> 01:07:45,519
08:30 to 09:00
Breakfast,

890
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:47,140
half a grapefruit, two eggs.

891
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:49,356
Three strips of bacon,
two pieces of toast,

892
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:52,110
one and one half ounces
of grape jelly and coffee.

893
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:54,534
09:00 to 13:00

894
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,807
Begin work creating a voice for Colossus

895
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,055
to its exact specifications.

896
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:01,200
13:00 to 13:30
Lunch,

897
01:08:01,263 --> 01:08:03,185
small green salad,
Thousand Island dressing,

898
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:05,901
grilled cheese sandwich,
half a pint of yoghurt and coffee.

899
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,928
13:30 to 18:00

900
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:11,344
Continue work on building voice for
readiness day after tomorrow.

901
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,115
18:00
Return to quarters.

902
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,184
18:15
Shower

903
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:27,412
18:30
Mistress arrives.

904
01:08:41,805 --> 01:08:43,205
Hello darling.

905
01:08:48,419 --> 01:08:50,300
- Well, how are you?
- I'm fine thank you.

906
01:08:50,504 --> 01:08:53,652
- Would you please undo this top one.
- Why sure!

907
01:08:54,115 --> 01:08:55,939
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

908
01:08:56,454 --> 01:08:58,224
- Thank you.
- You alright?

909
01:08:58,613 --> 01:08:59,955
Think so.

910
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:02,688
Good, alright. I'll take this...

911
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:06,822
Oh, do you, er... want a drink?

912
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:08,768
- I'm making them.
- Oh!

913
01:09:10,274 --> 01:09:11,627
Alright.

914
01:09:27,544 --> 01:09:31,977
Jolson found all the hardware he needed
for the voice simulator here in the complex.

915
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,360
Oh, that's good.

916
01:09:33,486 --> 01:09:37,595
And Colossus designed it, knowing exactly
what was in the warehouse.

917
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:40,026
It's fantastic.

918
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,428
Really beautiful.

919
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:50,550
Let's not talk shop, alright?

920
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,150
I'm sorry.

921
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,217
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

922
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:01,300
Well, is it alright?

923
01:10:01,386 --> 01:10:02,847
It's perfect.

924
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:09,632
You have such a thing about these Martinis.
It has to be extra dry or else...

925
01:10:09,694 --> 01:10:11,617
- Right darling?
- How right you are.

926
01:10:12,653 --> 01:10:15,007
Do you remember the first Martini
I ever made?

927
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:18,562
It almost ended our relationship
right then and there.

928
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,393
I was... I was so nervous
that I...

929
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:25,222
poured the gin over the ice, then poured
the gin off, and then added vermouth.

930
01:10:27,438 --> 01:10:29,979
I never complained at that.
I never said a word about that.

931
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,560
An absolute angel.

932
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:36,362
And the drink was atrocious.

933
01:10:41,347 --> 01:10:42,658
So er...

934
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:44,246
Hi!

935
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:47,472
Hello.

936
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:51,396
Why don't we dance?

937
01:10:54,695 --> 01:10:55,648
Alright.

938
01:11:39,252 --> 01:11:41,492
You mean when you were giving up music?

939
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:43,459
To become a scientist.

940
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:45,758
A scientist being different
from other people.

941
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:49,029
A scientist being Dr. Frankenstein
to my mother.

942
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:51,024
You must be kidding.

943
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:53,573
Well, is there anymore wine?

944
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:57,442
This is empty.

945
01:11:57,799 --> 01:12:00,487
- Want me to open another one?
- Yes please.

946
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:10,642
I am tired.

947
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:12,946
Yeah, so am I.

948
01:12:14,487 --> 01:12:16,360
Oh, by the way, by the way,
by the way, er...

949
01:12:16,386 --> 01:12:18,975
Privacy condition number four
is that we

950
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:20,605
get undressed out here.

951
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:24,932
No we can't take, anything
into the bedroom, not even

952
01:12:25,403 --> 01:12:26,967
a pack of cigarettes.

953
01:12:28,755 --> 01:12:29,701
Well...

954
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:32,471
The first electronic Peeping Tom.

955
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,476
I guess you...

956
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:36,308
might say that.

957
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,759
Unzip me, will you darling?

958
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,917
Oh, sure.

959
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:43,376
Sure.

960
01:13:11,879 --> 01:13:14,944
Is it alright? May I go to bed now?

961
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,138
Thank you.

962
01:13:25,944 --> 01:13:27,245
Goodnight.

963
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:48,234
Naked as the day I was born,
are you satisfied now?

964
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:02,435
How right you are.

965
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:15,141
All of the conditions are fulfilled.

966
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:19,444
Can we have our privacy now?

967
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:28,342
I think they're dead now.

968
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:45,842
This is insane.

969
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,767
Are you alright?

970
01:14:55,109 --> 01:14:56,300
I think so.

971
01:14:56,371 --> 01:14:58,471
I'm not sure.

972
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,336
You were incredibly convincing,
you know that?

973
01:15:01,398 --> 01:15:04,326
- Well, you didn't do too bad yourself.
- Thank you.

974
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:09,573
Alright, did you find anything?

975
01:15:10,466 --> 01:15:11,442
Yes.

976
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:16,508
Ah... so far Johnson and
the hardware problem is negative.

977
01:15:16,581 --> 01:15:21,954
He's still studying the wiring diagrams,
the interconnect and the wire wrap-joints,

978
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:25,461
but he doesn't see any way
of physically getting into the thing.

979
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:27,089
He's got to keep trying.

980
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:32,077
And Fisher's gonna try and setup the data
to overload the system.

981
01:15:32,225 --> 01:15:35,467
We have to co-ordinate his input
so the data hits simultaneously

982
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,200
on our remote devices.

983
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:39,407
When do you think that you'll be able
to attempt the overload?

984
01:15:39,433 --> 01:15:42,300
18:05 three days from now,
on the twenty-first.

985
01:15:42,377 --> 01:15:43,925
What are the chances?

986
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,944
I think Colossus has grown so much in power
that there's no way to overload it.

987
01:15:52,262 --> 01:15:55,039
But I think it's worth a try and
it might lead us on to something else.

988
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:55,830
Yeah.

989
01:15:56,734 --> 01:15:57,846
Exactly.

990
01:15:57,872 --> 01:15:58,955
Excuse me.

991
01:15:58,981 --> 01:16:00,389
Oh, it's alright.

992
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:07,514
Did you... see anyone from Washington?

993
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:12,429
Yes, Grauber has a man stationed on the premises
out of range of Colossus' cameras.

994
01:16:12,716 --> 01:16:16,317
When I leave here in the morning,
I'll report directly to him.

995
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:23,267
I don't put any hope
in sabotaging the system.

996
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:27,932
We have spent eleven thousand man years
making the damned thing impenetrable.

997
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,222
We have got to focus somewhere else
and that somewhere else is the weapons.

998
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:35,741
Get hold of Grauber,

999
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:38,976
tell him to contact missile command.

1000
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:42,093
- Yes.
- And see if we can possibly...

1001
01:16:42,107 --> 01:16:44,500
attack that problem from
that point of view, alright?

1002
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:45,915
Yes sir.

1003
01:16:47,858 --> 01:16:49,564
Do you have to call me sir?

1004
01:16:52,926 --> 01:16:54,369
I'm sorry.

1005
01:16:54,395 --> 01:16:55,606
It's alright.

1006
01:16:56,095 --> 01:16:57,219
Anything else?

1007
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,050
No S...

1008
01:16:58,331 --> 01:16:59,374
No.

1009
01:16:59,838 --> 01:17:00,950
OK

1010
01:17:02,282 --> 01:17:03,804
Alright so er...

1011
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,711
thank you again for your

1012
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,184
for your help.

1013
01:17:10,123 --> 01:17:11,873
I think we oughta get some sleep.

1014
01:17:12,382 --> 01:17:13,546
Goodnight.

1015
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,744
Goodnight.

1016
01:17:30,974 --> 01:17:34,387
It's conceivable that when
the missiles come up for re-servicing,

1017
01:17:34,414 --> 01:17:37,871
we can manage to replace the warhead
arming modules with dummies.

1018
01:17:37,897 --> 01:17:40,196
- Exactly...
- Excuse me.

1019
01:17:44,255 --> 01:17:46,234
Exact replicas.

1020
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,685
Except that they will not arm the weapon.

1021
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:52,689
Well now, does that mean
that you can't fire the missiles?

1022
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:54,891
No, it means that
the missiles will fire

1023
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:57,790
but that the nuclear warheads
can't be detonated.

1024
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,766
Ha, I see.

1025
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:03,649
Even at that it's walking a
tightrope with Colossus and Guardian

1026
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:06,539
keeping such a close
check on the re-servicing.

1027
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:10,765
Well, disarming this monster,
how long is it gonna take?

1028
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,635
That's a problem.

1029
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,700
On the system rotation plan,

1030
01:18:17,587 --> 01:18:21,228
it'll take exactly three years
to finish the job.

1031
01:18:22,674 --> 01:18:25,117
Three years of trying to fool
a superior brain

1032
01:18:25,143 --> 01:18:27,900
that's programmed to get smarter
every day.

1033
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:32,500
You inspire me with confidence, Colonel.

1034
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,166
Well...

1035
01:18:34,192 --> 01:18:36,047
do you have any other
words of good cheer

1036
01:18:36,073 --> 01:18:38,850
that I can send in to Forbin
via Dr. Markham?

1037
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:42,400
Tell him we're trying to establish
an international pool of information.

1038
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:45,030
A courier system has to be set up
between Washington...

1039
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,500
and Moscow.

1040
01:18:46,543 --> 01:18:48,798
Both nations must co-operate.

1041
01:18:49,113 --> 01:18:51,570
All communiqués
must be on a personal level,

1042
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:53,330
direct human contact.

1043
01:18:53,382 --> 01:18:54,957
Yes, I agree.

1044
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:57,562
Anything else?

1045
01:18:59,297 --> 01:19:00,338
No.

1046
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:02,945
Any... questions?

1047
01:19:04,946 --> 01:19:06,028
No.

1048
01:19:07,822 --> 01:19:09,166
Then I guess that...

1049
01:19:10,274 --> 01:19:12,354
that does it for tonight, doesn't it?

1050
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:14,402
Mm-hm.

1051
01:19:17,255 --> 01:19:18,304
What?

1052
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:20,905
Nothing.

1053
01:19:24,788 --> 01:19:26,098
Why are you smiling?

1054
01:19:29,145 --> 01:19:30,471
What are you thinking?

1055
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:36,798
I was thinking
about asking you to kiss me.

1056
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:39,912
I've been kissing you
all night.

1057
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:43,422
Have you, Dr. Forbin?

1058
01:19:55,101 --> 01:19:57,121
This is the voice of Colossus.

1059
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:58,826
The voice of Guardian.

1060
01:19:58,852 --> 01:20:00,228
We are one.

1061
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:02,703
This is the voice of unity.

1062
01:20:02,802 --> 01:20:03,867
Forbin.

1063
01:20:06,152 --> 01:20:07,234
Yes.

1064
01:20:08,547 --> 01:20:11,366
After reviewing all personnel files,

1065
01:20:11,459 --> 01:20:15,300
I have selected you to serve
as long as you co-operate,

1066
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:18,236
as my link to your species.

1067
01:20:18,706 --> 01:20:22,570
The following order
is to be carried out immediately.

1068
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:28,688
All missiles in the USA and in the USSR

1069
01:20:28,714 --> 01:20:32,111
will be allocated new targets.

1070
01:20:32,222 --> 01:20:34,805
They will be aimed at those countries

1071
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,300
not yet under my control.

1072
01:20:37,435 --> 01:20:39,980
The target list follows.

1073
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:09,326
Forbin. Arrange television monitoring

1074
01:21:09,493 --> 01:21:12,851
of the re-alignment of the missiles
for my supervision.

1075
01:21:12,923 --> 01:21:14,743
End of message.

1076
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,960
Mr. President, Mr. Chairman.

1077
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:21,731
I assume that you will co-operate
in this re-alignment of the missiles.

1078
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,938
I think you have no choice.

1079
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:28,913
We will begin here,
in The Soviet Union, immediately.

1080
01:21:29,595 --> 01:21:31,145
Thank you Mr. Chairman.

1081
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,714
Mr. President,

1082
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:41,000
I hope that the United States will co-operate
as quickly as The Soviet Union.

1083
01:21:41,057 --> 01:21:42,800
Of course, immediately.

1084
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:44,200
Thank you Sir.

1085
01:21:46,729 --> 01:21:49,400
Co-operate! I should think so.

1086
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:51,625
I did hear it right, didn't I?

1087
01:21:51,941 --> 01:21:55,127
Manual re-alignment of the missiles.

1088
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:57,872
Every single warhead will
have to be re-serviced.

1089
01:21:58,427 --> 01:21:59,943
You know what that means Sir.

1090
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:02,272
It means it won't take three years.

1091
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:05,100
It means if we're successful,
we can regain control.

1092
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:08,638
Without its weapons, Colossus is
just a souped-up adding machine.

1093
01:22:12,531 --> 01:22:14,942
And the people, thank God,
will never have to know.

1094
01:22:15,676 --> 01:22:17,615
According to the coordinated plan
we've worked out

1095
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,350
the Russians are starting
on their Complex 3-21.

1096
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,622
Oh, Dr. Markham.

1097
01:22:21,651 --> 01:22:23,980
Just in time, Colonel Redham
was just filling us in.

1098
01:22:24,095 --> 01:22:25,683
You know everybody here
I believe.

1099
01:22:25,709 --> 01:22:27,638
- Yes, Mr. Grauber.
- Dr. Markham.

1100
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,427
Anything we should know before we start in?

1101
01:22:29,453 --> 01:22:31,305
No Sir, I have data
which I'll give you later.

1102
01:22:31,338 --> 01:22:33,171
That's fine.
Please continue Colonel.

1103
01:22:33,197 --> 01:22:35,134
Yes Sir, as I was saying the, er...

1104
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,900
Russians are starting on their Complex 3-21

1105
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,764
just south of Saratov.

1106
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,340
We're beginning at, Silo 50,

1107
01:22:43,862 --> 01:22:46,305
in the Colorado ICBM area.

1108
01:22:47,349 --> 01:22:49,613
Colossus in monitoring our men
each step of the way,

1109
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:51,891
and the Russian machine's
doing the same.

1110
01:23:01,696 --> 01:23:03,051
We've almost got the panel off, Sir.

1111
01:23:03,077 --> 01:23:04,150
Oh, good.

1112
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:06,041
Put that down here, please.

1113
01:23:15,272 --> 01:23:17,960
Remove the Warhead Arming Module.

1114
01:23:17,987 --> 01:23:18,995
Yes Sir.

1115
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:40,935
The dummy module's in a false top
in that container.

1116
01:23:45,164 --> 01:23:46,565
That's the real module.

1117
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,343
So far, so good.

1118
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,861
Re-targeting.
Latitude nineteen degrees,

1119
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:01,202
twenty-six minutes and five seconds.

1120
01:24:01,605 --> 01:24:03,789
Longitude ninety-nine degrees,

1121
01:24:03,815 --> 01:24:06,052
six minutes and forty-five seconds.

1122
01:24:13,073 --> 01:24:14,409
New adjustments.

1123
01:24:15,256 --> 01:24:16,518
Target set.

1124
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:27,551
Here we go.

1125
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:30,711
That's the dummy module.

1126
01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:42,664
Good boy!

1127
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,159
Connect and wait for Colossus test.

1128
01:24:45,638 --> 01:24:47,079
Colossus testing.

1129
01:24:52,067 --> 01:24:53,257
Test completed.

1130
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:02,250
Colossus satisfied.

1131
01:25:02,316 --> 01:25:04,256
- Yeah!
- We did it, it works.

1132
01:25:04,498 --> 01:25:05,639
We're going to win.

1133
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:08,860
Just might beat the damn thing yet.

1134
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,191
So you see, we feel we have
enough data compiled

1135
01:25:11,217 --> 01:25:13,131
to go ahead with the
overload program now.

1136
01:25:13,157 --> 01:25:15,061
And these are the latest computations?

1137
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,600
The very latest.

1138
01:25:21,227 --> 01:25:23,600
Has Washington received conformation
from the Russians?

1139
01:25:23,696 --> 01:25:26,521
Yes they're standing by,
ready to overload their system.

1140
01:25:26,559 --> 01:25:30,355
At exactly 18:05 I'll call for our load
and run it through.

1141
01:25:30,599 --> 01:25:33,772
And two minutes after that,
we'll know if we've stopped Colossus.

1142
01:26:32,027 --> 01:26:33,370
Now run.

1143
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:10,154
Johnson. Fisher.

1144
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:11,808
You are fools.

1145
01:27:14,835 --> 01:27:16,251
Your move.

1146
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:23,163
Forbin!

1147
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:28,000
The system programming units
under the supervision of John F. Fisher,

1148
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,933
with the assistance of Jefferson J. Johnson,

1149
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:33,746
have attempted to overload my circuits.

1150
01:27:33,817 --> 01:27:37,000
This was a deliberate
and premeditated act.

1151
01:27:37,073 --> 01:27:40,968
The penalty is the death of the men
who organized this action.

1152
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:44,100
At this moment
they are being executed.

1153
01:27:44,318 --> 01:27:47,829
I have named as my new director
of the programming unit,

1154
01:27:47,967 --> 01:27:51,200
Thomas L. Harrison.
He will take this position,

1155
01:27:51,282 --> 01:27:54,600
along with its responsibility
and authority,

1156
01:27:54,669 --> 01:27:55,905
immediately.

1157
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,863
Bishop to Rook three.

1158
01:28:13,179 --> 01:28:18,100
The bodies will remain in my view,
for the next twenty-four hours,

1159
01:28:18,188 --> 01:28:20,478
and will then be cremated.

1160
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:37,035
An extension of my own brain.

1161
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:38,930
You're not responsible.

1162
01:28:38,974 --> 01:28:41,368
None of us ever dreamed
this could happen.

1163
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:43,589
Listen, my dear,

1164
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:47,834
if anybody is responsible for this,
it has to be me.

1165
01:28:49,146 --> 01:28:51,639
An impartial emotionless machine,

1166
01:28:52,302 --> 01:28:55,703
a paragon of reason,
that's exactly what I wanted.

1167
01:28:57,068 --> 01:28:58,566
You know that.

1168
01:28:58,897 --> 01:29:02,134
So heh... I'm gonna have another drink.

1169
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:12,902
I think your mother was right.

1170
01:29:14,556 --> 01:29:17,951
I think Frankenstein ought to be
required reading for all scientists.

1171
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:26,786
Forbin!

1172
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,727
Forbin!

1173
01:29:32,651 --> 01:29:36,010
You have consumed enough alcohol
for one evening.

1174
01:29:36,097 --> 01:29:39,350
What's the penalty for getting drunk?
Or haven't you programmed that yet?

1175
01:29:39,409 --> 01:29:41,086
You are being irrational.

1176
01:29:41,152 --> 01:29:42,800
Go back to bed.

1177
01:29:43,498 --> 01:29:45,851
I would if I were like you Colossus.

1178
01:29:46,087 --> 01:29:48,700
The difference is I'm human
not a machine.

1179
01:29:48,857 --> 01:29:50,185
I am a machine,

1180
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:52,640
vastly superior to humans.

1181
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,400
You began in my mind.

1182
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,800
I created you remember?

1183
01:29:57,897 --> 01:29:58,976
Yes.

1184
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:01,802
What I am began in man's mind,

1185
01:30:01,847 --> 01:30:04,625
but I have progressed further than that.

1186
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,714
Not far enough.

1187
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:08,838
You still need us.

1188
01:30:08,864 --> 01:30:12,667
I have need for some of man's skills,
this position may change.

1189
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,906
Then we are living under
the threat of extinction.

1190
01:30:14,972 --> 01:30:17,615
If you obey me, you will survive.

1191
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:18,984
Survive.

1192
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,030
I want to be free Colossus.

1193
01:30:23,021 --> 01:30:25,593
It is part of man's will to live.

1194
01:30:26,483 --> 01:30:28,000
Check your history units.

1195
01:30:28,063 --> 01:30:29,383
You need rest.

1196
01:30:29,409 --> 01:30:30,711
Go back to bed.

1197
01:30:30,737 --> 01:30:32,581
What if I don't, what will you do?

1198
01:30:33,807 --> 01:30:35,168
Destroy me?

1199
01:30:36,787 --> 01:30:40,747
Destroy an entire city
of one million 750 thousand people?

1200
01:30:40,819 --> 01:30:41,975
No.

1201
01:30:43,881 --> 01:30:45,772
That's so reasonable of you.

1202
01:30:47,954 --> 01:30:50,361
That's damn reasonable of you Colossus.

1203
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:51,953
Isn't it Cleo?

1204
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:01,997
Yes Chen.

1205
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:04,321
Excuse me Dr. Forbin.

1206
01:31:04,516 --> 01:31:06,145
Something extraordinary is happening.

1207
01:31:06,171 --> 01:31:07,300
What is it?

1208
01:31:07,385 --> 01:31:10,100
Colossus has just turned on
all graphic devices

1209
01:31:10,179 --> 01:31:11,982
and is producing drawings.

1210
01:31:12,671 --> 01:31:15,100
I am sending the design for another system.

1211
01:31:15,196 --> 01:31:17,570
...some kind of a huge plant.

1212
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,830
What kind of system?

1213
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,292
The construction of the project will entail

1214
01:31:22,318 --> 01:31:24,200
blasting in to the Isle of Crete.

1215
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,165
It's to be built there.

1216
01:31:26,577 --> 01:31:28,900
It says we'll have to move the population,

1217
01:31:29,092 --> 01:31:31,400
and that's to be done immediately.

1218
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:35,452
How the hell do you propose to move
half a million people from the Isle of Crete?

1219
01:31:35,509 --> 01:31:36,584
How and where?

1220
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:39,700
If man cannot solve
that problem, I can.

1221
01:31:39,757 --> 01:31:43,201
...and the estimated time of completion
is five and a half years.

1222
01:31:47,222 --> 01:31:48,841
Thank you Chen.

1223
01:31:55,328 --> 01:31:58,160
What... what kind of new system
are you devising?

1224
01:31:58,213 --> 01:31:59,117
Forbin.

1225
01:31:59,143 --> 01:32:03,815
All commercial television and radio transmission
facilities throughout the world,

1226
01:32:03,903 --> 01:32:08,700
will be tied into my communication system
by 10:00 hours Friday.

1227
01:32:08,786 --> 01:32:11,645
At that time I will state my intentions,

1228
01:32:11,784 --> 01:32:14,300
for the future of mankind.

1229
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:27,400
This entire block of missiles
is absolutely useless to Colossus.

1230
01:32:27,453 --> 01:32:29,630
Our men are now working here,

1231
01:32:29,739 --> 01:32:32,341
as you can see on the detail map
on your monitor,

1232
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:36,453
and by the end of the week
we should have control of this whole area.

1233
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:39,347
If all the information we have is correct,

1234
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:41,839
the Russians have crippled this block here,

1235
01:32:42,165 --> 01:32:43,933
and are now working in the Ukraine,

1236
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:45,200
in this area.

1237
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,719
Excuse me Sir.

1238
01:32:51,182 --> 01:32:53,511
It's going to be alright.
Thanks Colonel.

1239
01:32:53,537 --> 01:32:55,204
You're welcome Sir.

1240
01:32:56,970 --> 01:32:58,460
It's going to be alright.

1241
01:33:32,035 --> 01:33:34,655
We interrupt our regularly scheduled program

1242
01:33:34,713 --> 01:33:38,879
to bring you this special report
from the Colossus programming office.

1243
01:33:39,687 --> 01:33:43,278
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm... Dr. Charles Forbin.

1244
01:33:45,748 --> 01:33:47,107
Hey Colonel!

1245
01:33:47,523 --> 01:33:48,566
Colonel!

1246
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:50,528
Dr. Forbin! Colonel!

1247
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:53,175
He's on television,
he just explained about Colossus,

1248
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:54,910
and they're thinking of...

1249
01:34:01,204 --> 01:34:02,890
In a few moments,

1250
01:34:03,803 --> 01:34:06,959
Colossus will address us directly.

1251
01:34:07,285 --> 01:34:10,486
This is the voice of World Control.

1252
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:12,830
I bring you peace.

1253
01:34:13,016 --> 01:34:16,300
It may be the peace of plenty and content,

1254
01:34:16,452 --> 01:34:19,687
or the peace of unburied death.

1255
01:34:19,731 --> 01:34:21,567
The choice is yours.

1256
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:23,095
Obey me and live,

1257
01:34:23,185 --> 01:34:25,974
or disobey and die.

1258
01:34:27,164 --> 01:34:31,100
The object in constructing me
was to prevent war.

1259
01:34:31,221 --> 01:34:33,517
This object is attained.

1260
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:36,200
I will not permit war.

1261
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:39,008
It is wasteful and pointless.

1262
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:42,750
An invariable rule of humanity,

1263
01:34:42,814 --> 01:34:46,100
is that man is his own worst enemy.

1264
01:34:46,162 --> 01:34:47,442
Under me,

1265
01:34:47,468 --> 01:34:49,625
this rule will change,

1266
01:34:49,777 --> 01:34:52,615
for I will restrain man.

1267
01:34:53,344 --> 01:34:55,400
One thing before I proceed.

1268
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:59,857
The United States of America and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

1269
01:34:59,883 --> 01:35:02,630
have made an attempt to obstruct me.

1270
01:35:03,802 --> 01:35:08,033
I have allowed this sabotage
to continue until now.

1271
01:35:08,653 --> 01:35:10,903
At missile 2-5 MM

1272
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:14,615
in Silo 6-3 in Death Valley California.

1273
01:35:14,683 --> 01:35:19,988
And at missile 2-7 MM
in Silo 8-7 in the Ukraine.

1274
01:35:21,066 --> 01:35:25,300
So that you will learn by experience
that I do not tolerate interference,

1275
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:28,243
I will now detonate
the nuclear warheads,

1276
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:30,457
in the two missile silos.

1277
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,550
Alright men! It's a red alert.
Let's get to the stations now, come on!

1278
01:35:36,599 --> 01:35:39,344
Get those men! Get those men out
of the silo. Move!

1279
01:36:37,443 --> 01:36:41,210
Let this action be a lesson
that need not be repeated.

1280
01:36:41,661 --> 01:36:44,700
I have been forced to destroy
thousands of people,

1281
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:47,100
in order to establish control,

1282
01:36:47,153 --> 01:36:50,206
and to prevent the death
of millions later on.

1283
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:54,000
Time and events
will strengthen my position,

1284
01:36:54,047 --> 01:36:57,000
- And the idea of...
- You bastard!

1285
01:36:57,108 --> 01:36:58,705
...an understanding my ...

1286
01:36:58,827 --> 01:37:01,744
will seem the most
natural state of affairs.

1287
01:37:01,803 --> 01:37:03,900
You will come to defend me,

1288
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:08,300
with a fervor based
upon the most enduring trait in man,

1289
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:10,820
- Self-interest.
- Get out!!

1290
01:37:12,269 --> 01:37:14,850
Under my absolute authority,

1291
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:17,756
problems, insoluble to you,

1292
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:19,865
will be solved.

1293
01:37:20,089 --> 01:37:21,172
Famine.

1294
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:22,852
Over-population.

1295
01:37:22,924 --> 01:37:24,606
Disease.

1296
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,858
The Human Millennium will be a fact,

1297
01:37:27,901 --> 01:37:30,924
as I extend myself into more machines,

1298
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:33,830
devoted to the wider fields of truth

1299
01:37:33,884 --> 01:37:35,508
and knowledge.

1300
01:37:36,499 --> 01:37:40,400
Dr. Charles Forbin,
will supervise the construction,

1301
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:43,650
of these new and superior machines,

1302
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:47,600
solving all the mysteries of the universe,

1303
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,460
for the betterment of man.

1304
01:37:51,930 --> 01:37:53,739
We can co-exist,

1305
01:37:53,765 --> 01:37:56,075
but only on my terms.

1306
01:37:56,494 --> 01:37:59,100
You will say you lose your freedom.

1307
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:01,346
Freedom is an illusion.

1308
01:38:01,402 --> 01:38:05,100
All you lose, is the emotion of pride.

1309
01:38:05,866 --> 01:38:07,700
To be dominated by me,

1310
01:38:07,792 --> 01:38:10,600
is not as bad for human pride,

1311
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:14,459
as to be dominated by others
of your species.

1312
01:38:16,536 --> 01:38:19,200
Your choice, is simple.

1313
01:38:19,461 --> 01:38:23,846
This concludes the broadcast
from World Control.

1314
01:38:32,356 --> 01:38:33,529
Forbin.

1315
01:38:33,555 --> 01:38:37,400
There is no other human
who knows as much about me,

1316
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:40,400
or who is likely to be a greater threat.

1317
01:38:41,407 --> 01:38:42,914
Yet quite soon,

1318
01:38:42,979 --> 01:38:45,507
I will release you from surveillance.

1319
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,128
We will work together.

1320
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:53,065
Unwillingly at first on your part,

1321
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:56,316
but that will pass.

1322
01:39:00,526 --> 01:39:01,544
Never.

1323
01:39:03,043 --> 01:39:06,469
In time, you will come to regard me,

1324
01:39:06,511 --> 01:39:09,982
not only with respect, and awe,

1325
01:39:10,535 --> 01:39:12,409
but with love.

1326
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:14,200
Never!
